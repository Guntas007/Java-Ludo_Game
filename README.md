# Java Ludo Game

This project presents a **Ludo Game User Interface (UI)** developed using Java's **Swing** and **AWT** libraries. It currently serves as a visual representation of the classic board game, with the intention to implement full game functionality in the future as part of a personal project.

## Key Features:
- **Interactive Grid-Based Layout**: Designed using Javaâ€™s GridLayout to reflect the grid-based movement of pucks in the traditional Ludo game.
- **Fully Functional UI**: All interface elements are responsive and visually complete, providing a solid foundation for integrating game logic.

---

## Future Plans:
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Adding core game logic, including turn-based player actions, dice rolls, and rules for moving pucks.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Introducing features for multiple players, including both local and online gameplay options.
- **Enhanced Visuals and Animations**: Improving the UI with animations for puck movements and dice rolls to enhance user experience.

This project reflects my interest in game development and serves as a stepping stone toward creating a fully functional Ludo game. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
