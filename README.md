# Java Ludo Game

This project presents a **Ludo Game User Interface (UI)** developed using Java's **Swing** and **AWT** libraries. It currently serves as a visual representation of the classic board game, with the intention to implement full game functionality in the future as part of a personal project.

---

## Key Features:
- **Interactive Grid-Based Layout**: Designed using Javaâ€™s GridLayout to reflect the grid-based movement of pucks in the traditional Ludo game.
- **Fully Functional UI**: All interface elements are responsive and visually complete, providing a solid foundation for integrating game logic.

## Visuals of the UI:
- Full window: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/037ba27c-a3c0-4837-9b34-5e2c5daa7cbc)

## Future Plans:
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Adding core game logic, including turn-based player actions, dice rolls, and rules for moving pucks.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Introducing features for multiple players, including both local and online gameplay options.
- **Enhanced Visuals and Animations**: Improving the UI with animations for puck movements and dice rolls to enhance user experience.
